Just Havin Some Fun

It was nice for once to work on something that doesn't take half a year to make. 

P.S. I'm still working on Dead Fantasy 6+, I happen to have a lot on my plate this year so please be patient. This was a nice (quick) diversion, also helped me test out some new equipment & software.
