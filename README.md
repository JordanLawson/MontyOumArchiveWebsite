# MontyOumArchiveWebsite
Project designed to serve the dual purpose of archiving the work of film maker Monty Oum as well as learning/refining the necessary web development skills.
This involves collecting all the relevent items (videos, posts, photots, etc.), deciding on the best way to present that data, and building a website to implemenet that decision.
Since this website will involve the creation of many webpages of a similar style and purpose a MVC implementation would be best with the current choice being the Ruby on Rail framework.
